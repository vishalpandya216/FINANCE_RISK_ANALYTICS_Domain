# FINANCE_RISK_ANALYTICS_Domain
Project Description:

Objective: To predict credit risk (default) of consumers using various financial and demographic features.

Data Preparation: Included data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering. The dataset was split into training and test sets.

Modeling: Logistic regression models were used to predict the default probability. The initial model faced challenges with imbalanced data, which was addressed using techniques like SMOTE to balance the dataset.

Evaluation: The performance of the models was assessed using metrics like confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score. The balanced dataset model showed improved recall and precision, indicating better performance in identifying default cases.
